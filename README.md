# Pose-Classifier
Identifying the correct binding pose of ligand is important in docking based virtual high-throughput screening. This code implements two convolutional neural network approaches: a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) and an attention-based point cloud network (PCN) to improves virtual high-throughput screening to identify novel molecules against each target protein. The code is written in python with Tensorflow and Pytorch.
